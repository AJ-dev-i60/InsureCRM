## Notes 
- Backend API structure is in place but needs implementation
- Frontend development hasn't started yet
- Need to prioritize core features before adding enhancements
- Consider adding automated testing early in development
- Supabase cloud is being used. No local instances. Use Supabase API for Supabase operations.

This document will be updated as development progresses. Each feature will be moved from "Pending" to "In Progress" to "Completed" as work proceeds.
